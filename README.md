Slider Numbers Puzzle(solving algorithm)
App: Brain Training - Logic Puzzles (not my app)
My Name - Lin Htet Aung

About Game: 5x5 frame, 25 numbers included, To arrange them successfully
Movements - Right, Left, Up, Down (numbers in Row, Column will circulate)

My Algorithm's Advantages => flexible, not overloading, Human-like plays
God's Number 			        => 80 moves (just assuming);
Disadvantages			        => In {function lastRow()} ,  one or two moves are reducible
                             And if you want to PLAY 6rows, 6cols or 7rows, 6cols, etc....
                             Need to fix that {function lastRow()}, that function is problematic
                             May be that problem is caused by me because I concentrated on solving 5x5
                             and thought it should be "OK" in 6x6 and 7x7 too, this program is thinking like myself. 

Strong Point: still useful, perfectly executed in 5x5 games
